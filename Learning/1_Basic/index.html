        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
        specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a
        markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG,
        MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide
        Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2] CSS is designed to enable the
        separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and
        fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, since the
        content can be written without concern for its presentation; provide
        more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
        characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
        specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces
        complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css
        file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that
        share the file and its formatting.
